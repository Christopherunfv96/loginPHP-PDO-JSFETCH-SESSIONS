# Login

A simple login with html,javascript, php,MySQL bootstrap and 4 lines of css code :laughing:

## Installation

Don't forget to import the MySQL database [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
1. Import bd_login
2. Just there is an user : "christopher123" as username and "hola" as password.
3. If you want to add more user for testing,you'll have to make a query with php because all passwords saved in database are encrypted
    using PASSWORD_ARGON2ID.
4. I din't work with roles but I think I'' push soon.
```
